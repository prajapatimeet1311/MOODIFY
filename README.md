## 🧠 Dataset (Optional - Custom Training / Fine-Tuning)

By default, Moodify uses DeepFace’s built-in pre-trained emotion model. But for enthusiasts or researchers who want to train or fine-tune emotion detection, you can use the **FER-2013** dataset.

### 🔗 Download Dataset

[Download FER-2013 from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

### 📁 Folder Structure

```
fer2013/
├── train/
│   ├── angry/
│   ├── happy/
│   ├── ...
├── test/
│   ├── angry/
│   ├── happy/
│   ├── ...
```

### 📌 Usage

- Place the `fer2013/` folder in your project directory.
- This dataset is optional and only needed if you're modifying or training new models.
